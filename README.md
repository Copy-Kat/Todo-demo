# Todo app

Clone the repository and run the following command at the root directory.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

```
## Technologies used:

- NextJS + React for the fontend and server hosting
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Shadcn/ui for some components and theming
- Next-themes for night/light mode
- React-date-picker for time selection

## Features:

- Simple add/modify/delete actions for all todos
- Dashboard view of all the tasks and the main progress
- Calendar included for overview of due dates
- Responsive design for mobile/pc

## Improvements:

- Connect to a database and using server actions to manage todos (currently everything are stored in memory)
- More routes for different functions (already added a side tab for future usage)
- Better design
